Repo to keep track of my practice of CF problems rated 1500-1600.

Codeforces Profile - https://codeforces.com/profile/i_love_emilia

Problemset I will be following - [https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_SOLVED_DESC&tags=1500-1600]

I plan to do atleast 150 of them in the next 30 days starting 29 May, keeping such a repo will help me keep a track of what I have done and what I have remaining to do.

Currently questions done - 0
Questions TODO - 150

Will update rating after each contest with a description of how each contest went, and how I could have approached it better.

Will also be adding a track of the new techniques I learn.
 
Wish me luck!
